# Current Work Status (CURRENT_WORK_STATUS.md)

This is the single canonical handoff file for **DeutschFlow** to track progress across sequential agent invocations.

## Metadata

## Current Context
*   **Current Phase:** PHASE 4 PREPARATION — DATA PRESERVATION & MIGRATION PARITY
*   **Current Delivery Priority:** MOBILE FIRST — iOS/iPadOS + Android
*   **Phase Status:** PHASE 2 AND PHASE 3 COMPLETE; PHASE 4 SAFETY FOUNDATION ACTIVE
*   **Implementation Status:** ACTIVE ON `mobile-foundation`
*   **Current Task:** Build isolated source/target migration parity validation before introducing the native SQLite adapter or switching storage.
*   **Last Completed Task:** Extracted the unchanged `deutschflow_v2` implementation into an injected IndexedDB platform adapter and verified schema, CRUD, indexed queries, backup restore, exact SRS fields, and unchanged legacy wording in isolated tests.

## Decision Status
*   **Decision 1 (Packaging):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH CONDITION)
*   **Decision 2 (Synchronization):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH STAGED IMPLEMENTATION)
*   **Decision 3 (Cloud Account):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH STAGED IMPLEMENTATION)
*   **Decision 4 (AI Grading):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH CONDITION AND FUTURE EXTENSION)
*   **Decision 5 (Pronunciation):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH STAGED IMPLEMENTATION)
*   **Decision 6 (Notifications):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH CONDITION)
*   **Technical Decision 1 (Mobile SQLite):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS)
*   **Technical Decision 2 (Desktop SQLite):** DEFERRED UNTIL DESKTOP PHASE
*   **Technical Decision 3 (UI Framework):** RESOLVED (APPROVED WITH STAGED MIGRATION)
*   **Technical Implementation:** ACTIVE — PHASE 3 COMPLETE / PHASE 4 SAFETY PREPARATION STARTED
*   **Architecture Phase:** COMPLETE (DESIGN & PLANNING ONLY)

## Audit & Design Metrics
*   **current application version:** DeutschFlow Pro RC4 (`pro-rc1-2026-07-25`)
*   **implementation plan files created:**
    *   `05_TECHNICAL/DOCUMENTATION/MOBILE_FIRST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
    *   `05_TECHNICAL/DOCUMENTATION/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_GATES.md`
    *   `05_TECHNICAL/DOCUMENTATION/REGRESSION_PROTECTION_PLAN.md`

    *   `05_TECHNICAL/DOCUMENTATION/MOBILE_PLATFORM_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md`
    *   `05_TECHNICAL/DOCUMENTATION/FIRST_IMPLEMENTATION_TASK.md`
*   **unresolved questions:** None. Implementation plan complete.
*   **last agent:** OpenAI Codex

## Next Approved Action
*   Implement isolated migration mapping and parity checks with stable identity/provenance, exact SRS preservation, and content-fidelity assertions. Do not switch storage or modify real learner data until backup and parity gates pass.
